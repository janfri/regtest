2.2.1
Adapt git output to work with different git versions.
Simplify determination of filenames for outputs.
Add a test and Fix documentation.

2.2.0
Add a new method Regtest.log to allow the logging of temporary values which
could be of interest for different reasons (i. e. debugging).
With this version you can use `extend Regtest` to have the methods sample, log
and combinations as top level methods. This is experimental and therefore not
yet mentioned at README.

2.1.1
Adapt remaining examples of regtest/colorize to regtest/colors.

2.1.0
Use Process.clock_gettime for time measurements.
Eliminate dependency to colorize gem. So Regtest has no longer any
dependency.

2.0.0 Major Release

Incompatibilities to regtest 1.x
1. The methods sample and combinations are not longer defined as instance
methods but as as module methods only. Therefore you can't use it as mixed in
methods via include.
2. The exit code of regtest is now by default 1 if there are no plugins used which
check the results like regtest/git.
3. Regtest needs Ruby version 2.1 or higher.

New Features
Regtest can now be customized with a .regtestrc file in the home directory
and/or actual directory. If ENV['NOREGTESTRC'] is set then .regtestrc files
will not be loaded.
A simple plugin mechanism is implemented and two plugins are part of regtest:
regtest/colorize and regtest/git. Plugins are usual activated by require in
one of the .regtestrc files.
It is possible to change the exit codes for different return states of
Regtest.check_results. This is done with changing Regtest.exit_codes see
README.md for an example.

Further Changes
Reporting of statistics was reduced and the full filename for results files
are now reported when running regtest.
Some metatests are added.
Version constant Regtest::VERSION is also added.
Regtest.sample returns now the hash with result information. This could be
useful for plugins which overload this method.
A lot of internal refactoring and improving documentation was done.
