2.0.0.pre
This is a major release with following incompatibilities to regtest 1.x:
The exit code of regtest is by default 1 if there are no plugins used which
check the results like regtest/git.
Further Ruby version 2.1 or higher is needed to use regtest.

Regtest can now be customized with a .regtestrc file in the home directory
and/or actual directory. If ENV['NOREGTESTRC'] is set then .regtestrc files
will not be load.
A simple plugin mechanism is implemented and two plugins are part of regtest:
regtest/colorize and regtest/git. Plugins are usual activated by require in on
of the .regtestrc files.

Reporting of statistics for writing files is removed because it's not useful.
Now the full filename for results files are reported when running regtest.
Some metatests are added.
Version constant Regtest::VERSION is also added.
A lot of internal refactoring and improving documentation.
