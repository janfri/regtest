2.0.0.pre Major Release

Incompatibilities to regtest 1.x
1. The methods sample and combinations are not longer defined as instance
methods but as as module methods only. Therefore you can't use it as mixed in
methods via include.
2. The exit code of regtest is now by default 1 if there are no plugins used which
check the results like regtest/git.
3. Regtest needs Ruby version 2.1 or higher.

New Features
Regtest can now be customized with a .regtestrc file in the home directory
and/or actual directory. If ENV['NOREGTESTRC'] is set then .regtestrc files
will not be loaded.
A simple plugin mechanism is implemented and two plugins are part of regtest:
regtest/colorize and regtest/git. Plugins are usual activated by require in
one of the .regtestrc files.

Further Changes
Reporting of statistics for writing files is removed because it's not useful.
Now the full filename for results files are reported when running regtest.
Some metatests are added.
Version constant Regtest::VERSION is also added.
A lot of internal refactoring and improving documentation.
